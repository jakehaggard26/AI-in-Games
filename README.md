# AI-in-Games

### About this Repository
This repository is based off of things I learned from the book AI for Games (3rd Edition) by Ian Millington. Each chapter will have its own Unity project for it and within those projects will contain examples of the topics covered in that chapter. Not all chapters of this book will be found in this repository.
